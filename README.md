This program cannot run correctly from a file path that contains Cyrillic characters. Make sure to run it from your root folder (usually C:/ ) so that you don't get runtime errors.

You can either:

A. Run the binary uploaded to the Release tab as an Administrator and select which options you'd like

B. Install Python and the dependencies listed below and run the script from an elevated command prompt and select which options you'd like
Silent

Either can be run with the -silent argument as of v3.1. This will perform all available options of the version you're using.

You still need to run it as administrator.
